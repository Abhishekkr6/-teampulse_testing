# Live2 Test Assets

- `live2a.html`: Interactive status panel with simulated processing.
- `live2b.html`: Fake dashboard cycling conversion, latency, and error metrics.
- `live2c.html`: Timeline streaming placeholder operational events.

These files exist solely to bulk up the experimental branch and mimic a chaotic live testing suite.
